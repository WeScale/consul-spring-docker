# consul-spring-docker

This "hello world" project can be use to:
- launch a simple webservice with spring boot
- create a docker with maven / spring boot (just launch mvn package docker:build)
- this docker connect to consul on 192.168.99.100:8500

I push the docker to: slavayssierewescale/consuldemo on the DockerHub
